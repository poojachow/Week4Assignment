Single Number II:
Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one which occurs once.
Find that element which does not appear thrice.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.
Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Example :
Input : [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Output : 4

Divide Integers:
Divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.
Return the floor of the result of the division.
Example:
5 / 2 = 2
Also, consider if there can be overflow cases. For overflow case, return INT_MAX.

Gray Code:
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
There might be multiple gray code sequences possible for a given n.
Return any such sequence.

Permutations:
Given a collection of numbers, return all possible permutations.
Example:
[1,2,3] will have the following permutations:
[1,2,3]
[1,3,2]
[2,1,3] 
[2,3,1] 
[3,1,2] 
[3,2,1]
